// A conversation is anchored to a Design Request, NOT to an Order. This is
// intentional: an Order is just what a Design Request becomes once it's
// approved (Order.design_request_id points back to it). By keying threads
// off design_request_id, the same conversation naturally carries over from
// "discussing the design" to "discussing production/delivery" — which is
// exactly the continuity the workflow calls for. The Order module's
// "Message" button links back to this same design_request_id instead of
// opening a separate order-scoped conversation.
